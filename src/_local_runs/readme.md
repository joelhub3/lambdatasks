# Hi!

This isn't part of the project -- it's just for running locally. One example invocation has been provided.
Feel free to modify this as needed.

To run, from the project, when you've activated the virtual environment, you can run `PYTHONPATH=src python3 src/_local/run.py` to test the application.
